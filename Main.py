# replace the red pixels ( or undesired area ) with

## 1. Hue: This channel encodes color information. Hue can be 
# thought of an angle where 0 degree corresponds to the red color,  
# 120 degrees corresponds to the green color, and 240 degrees  
# corresponds to the blue color. 
  
## 2. Saturation: This channel encodes the intensity/purity of color. 
# For example, pink is less saturated than red. 
  
## 3. Value: This channel encodes the brightness of color. 
# Shading and gloss components of an image appear in this  
# channel reading the videocapture vide
